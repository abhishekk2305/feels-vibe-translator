# feels — One Pager

## Problem
Gen Z spends hours on TikTok, Instagram, and meme platforms. They crave **authentic, fast, expressive tools** to share how they feel. Existing meme tools are clunky and slow, and professional design apps are overkill.

## Solution
**feels** turns your vibe into viral content in seconds.  
Input your mood (text/voice/photo) → AI generates memes, captions, and visuals → share or remix instantly.

## Why Now
- AI content tools are going mainstream, but most target productivity.  
- Gen Z wants **fun + speed**, not just productivity.  
- Viral loop mechanics (remix, challenges) can drive growth organically.

## Product
- **Emotion Detection**: Text, voice, photo inputs.  
- **AI Content Creation**: Instant meme/caption/image.  
- **Remix & Share**: Social challenges + remix loops.  
- **Feed**: See trending vibes, top moods, most remixed posts.
