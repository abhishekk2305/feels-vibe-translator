üü¢ Replit Project Prompt: Global AI Vibe Translator (Remixz) ‚Äî Multi-Platform Social App for Gen Z
‚ö°Ô∏è IMPORTANT OVERVIEW
I want to build a world-class AI-powered social app for Gen Z ‚Äî called Remixz ‚Äî that works as BOTH:

A true mobile app (for Android and iOS, using React Native/Expo or Flutter)

AND a responsive web app (that‚Äôs also a PWA if possible, to ‚Äúinstall‚Äù from a browser)

Everything must look, feel, and function like a modern mobile-first social media platform (think TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat)‚Äîbut with my unique ‚Äúvibe‚ÜíAI meme/video/image‚Äù twist!

üî• CORE FEATURES & USER FLOWS
Main Features for MVP (Must Work on Both Mobile and Web):

Onboarding: Fun, fluid intro that instantly demonstrates the ‚Äúvibe translation‚Äù effect when the user tells/shows how they feel.

Vibe/Emotion Detection: Users can express a feeling by:

Typing text

Speaking (voice-to-text)

Uploading a selfie/pic
The app uses AI to detect emotion or ‚Äúmood‚Äù from this input.

AI Meme / Image / Video Generation: Instantly generates a meme, image, or short video matching the mood, using AI models.

Easy Customization: Users can edit the meme (text, stickers, effects), easily on both phone and web.

Sharing: One-tap share to internal feed, chat, and external platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.) ‚Äî ‚Äúviral-first‚Äù flow.

Discovery: Scrollable feeds (local, global, trending); comment, like, remix other users‚Äô creations.

Stories (Ephemeral Content): Posts that disappear after 24 hours.

Direct Messaging (DM/Chat): Private chat for sharing memes and reactions.

Short-Form Video Tools: Users can create/upload/consume quick, TikTok-style videos (with edits/effects).

User Profile & Feeds: Each user has a profile, home feed, and can switch between global/local feeds.

Safety & Moderation: All content is AI-moderated for privacy and community guidelines.

Advanced/Future Features (Show me placeholders/comments for these):

Duets, remixes, group mashes

AR/AI filters, live streaming, interest groups/communities

Gamification (badges, streaks), creator monetization, social commerce, analytics

Voice posts, local language adaptation, personalization

üîó API & INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS (You MUST automate these)
Please use these APIs/tools for each area (choose free/low-cost options):
Vibe/Emotion detection:
Use OpenAI or Hugging Face API for text; Whisper or AssemblyAI for voice; OpenAI/Azure for image-emotion if possible.

AI meme/image/video generation:
Use DALL¬∑E, Stable Diffusion, or Replicate API for media; use Pillow or similar for text overlays.

Voice-to-text:
Whisper API or AssemblyAI‚Äîauto transcribe uploaded voice.

Content moderation:
OpenAI Moderation or Azure Moderator for text & images; moderate all uploads before display.

Media storage:
Store on AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudflare R2; deliver via a performant CDN.

External sharing:

API KEYS
Always tell me clearly if you need an API key. Show me how to add it securely inside Replit.

üì± TECH STACK & PLATFORMS
MOBILE APP: Build with React Native + Expo (preferred for easy testing, iOS/Android support), or Flutter if more suitable.

WEB APP: Build in React, Next.js, or similar, fully responsive, PWA enabled if possible.

Show me step-by-step how to preview the app on my phone (Expo Go, QR code, or similar) and web.

Document any settings (API keys etc.) I can manage myself.

üë®üíª USER EXPERIENCE
Build everything for:

Mobile-first, touch-friendly navigation, gestures, and UI

Modern, fun, Gen Z-inspired design and language

Super simple onboarding ‚Äî show off the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù AI in first use

Easy troubleshooting for a non-coder; always explain next steps in plain language

üìã IN CASE OF ERRORS OR MISSING INFO
Pause and show me a clear, simple error message with instructions.

If any service is unavailable, use the next-best free/popular service and tell me about it.

üëë EXTRAS
Include placeholders or comments for advanced/future features (e.g., AR, monetization) so we can expand later.

Make it easy for me (a non-coder) to launch, demo, and share the app.

üöÄ SUMMARY:
MOBILE (React Native/Expo or Flutter) + WEB (React/Next.js or PWA)

All features above, all API integrations with key prompts

Focus on viral, Gen Z-centric, creative, and real-time social flows

Simple docs and admin management for a non-developer

If anything needs my input to proceed, pause and prompt me in plain English.
Thank you! Let‚Äôs make the next biggest mobile + web social app‚Äîstep by step, no coding needed from me!
