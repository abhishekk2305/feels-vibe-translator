Ultimate Replit Prompt for Polished, Investor-Ready MVP
General Goal
Upgrade my existing Gen Z “feels” AI app MVP (currently a functional web app) to be visually appealing, professional, and investor-ready. I want it to look and feel like a public beta, not a hackathon demo.

Detailed Instructions
1. UI/UX Polish:

Apply modern, bold, and playful styling using Tailwind CSS or similar—think Gen Z aesthetics: gradients, rounded corners, energetic colors (lavender, blue, pink, light neutral).

Make all primary buttons large, vibrant, and clearly labeled.

Add space, use card-like containers for chat blocks or results.

Add app logo, favicon, and a clean navigation/header bar with your brand name (“feels ✨”).

Elevate font to something bolder and rounded (e.g., Poppins/Montserrat).

Animate button hovers and transitions for delight.

2. Robust Mobile Responsiveness:

Use CSS grid/flexbox and media queries to ensure the UI rearranges on mobile (one column for inputs/chat, buttons large and touch-friendly).

No horizontal scroll or overlapping components on mobile.

All text should be 15px+ on phones (for readability).

Test and polish on both iOS & Android browser emulators right in the browser.

Add a test “mobile first” flow for entering a vibe, submitting, and reading output.

3. “Vibe Presets”/Tone Dropdown:

Add a dropdown/select at the top of the input form with 4–6 preset moods (e.g., “Happy,” “Sad,” “Anxious,” “Silly,” “Excited,” “Random!”).

User should be able to:

Either select a preset (button) or type a custom mood (text input).

When a preset is selected, show it as active (highlighted button).

On submit, combine user’s input (“I feel ___” or selected preset) for the AI prompt.

Present the presets as colored “pill” buttons on desktop, and as a space-saving dropdown on mobile.

Default to the “Happy” or “Trending” preset on page load.

4. Copy/Export Result:

Add a “Copy to Clipboard” button below every AI output.

Show a “Copied!” tooltip/animation when clicked.

Optionally, add a “Download as image/text” button for easy sharing.

5. Basic Analytics:

Integrate a privacy-respecting analytics tool (like Plausible, Posthog, or a simple custom server-side counter):

Log: site visits, “vibe” submissions, most selected preset, most frequent result copy-button presses.

Show an admin-only / hidden dashboard with basic stats (“123 vibes generated today”).

Even a simple badge (“Total vibes so far: 1,234”) in the footer is enough for demo.

6. Hosting on a Custom Domain:

Prepare app for easy deployment on Vercel or Netlify.

Provide a README with deploy instructions.

Add a clear “deployed on [domain]” badge/link.

Ensure all resources (images/fonts/analytics) load on the custom domain.

7. Misc/Final Touches:

Add a light/dark mode toggle.

Include a “Report a bug/feedback” link (mailto/email/Typeform popup).

Make sure the “demo” link and brand are visible and clickable on every page.

Test major flows for accessibility (keyboard navigation, color contrast).
