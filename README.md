## ðŸ™Œ A Note from the Maker
Hi, this is Abhishek Dhama, Product Manager.
I'd like to mention here that feels started as a playful experiment:  
> Could a single person ship a Gen Z-facing AI app in under two weeks and test if people would use it?  

This repo documents that journey â€” design, analytics, and lessons learned.  
Feedback is welcome on both the **product** and the **approach**.
